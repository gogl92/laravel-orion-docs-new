## Preparing migrations and models

Before diving into the search functionality, we need to prepare our models and migrations. The episode covers all the necessary steps to get you ready for exploring Orion's search magic :)

## Search - keyword search

One of the available search options is keyword search. It allows you to lookup models that match a provided keyword in ***any*** of the specified attributes, similar to what a typical search bar does.

## Search - filters

Another way of searching for models is to use filters. Think of it as writing Eloquent query, but on the frontend side.

## Search - sorting

When performing a search query, you can also sort the results. Let's take a look how you can accomplish that, shall we? :)

## Search - scopes

When doing a lookup, you can take it one step further, and make the API even simpler and more maintainable by utilizing scopes.
